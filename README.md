# Elderguard
Stonehill Techno fest 2026

this tech is a detection app that helps with the elderly with their medical and their daily schedule management, if any harm is caused to the individual and is captured on the feed it ,will be notified and the app will ask wheither the individual is ok, and will send disstress signals(medical emergancuy call) if the said individual is non-responsive.

We are using MIT-App-inventor for making this because it gives an easy way to get it done with least amount of encountering any form of syntax error.
